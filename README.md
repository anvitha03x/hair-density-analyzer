# Hair Density Analyzer Using Image Processing

## Problem Statement

Hair loss, thinning, and regrowth are concerns commonly encountered in both cosmetic and healthcare fields. Traditionally, progress is monitored through subjective observation or manual photo comparisons, which can be inconsistent and unreliable. This project addresses that limitation by providing an **automated, image-based system to quantify hair density changes over time**.

By comparing the density of edges (which represent hair strands) in two images of the scalp, the system classifies the result as **thickening**, **thinning**, or **no change**. This enables professionals and individuals to track hair treatment effectiveness or natural progression more accurately.

## Use Case Context

This tool is especially relevant in the following domains:

* **Cosmetic Industry**

  * Used by dermatologists, trichologists, and hair clinics to assess the effectiveness of hair treatments (e.g., PRP therapy, minoxidil, hair serums).
  * Can support before-and-after comparisons for product testing, marketing, or client updates.

* **Healthcare Sector**

  * Helps clinicians monitor patients experiencing hair loss due to medical conditions such as alopecia, hormonal imbalances, or chemotherapy.
  * Assists in non-invasive tracking without needing expensive imaging equipment.

Absolutely — here’s the cleaned-up version of the key sections for your `README.md`, **with `IPython` removed** from both the technology list and the explanation.

| **Python 3.x**       | Main programming language for development                                          |
| **OpenCV**           | For reading, capturing, resizing, and processing images (including edge detection) |
| **NumPy**            | For numerical operations and working with image arrays                             |
| **Pillow (PIL)**     | For additional image handling and manipulation                                     |
| **Matplotlib**       | To display side-by-side comparisons and visualize the results                      |

These tools were chosen for their stability, speed, and popularity in image analysis tasks within the Python ecosystem.

## How It Works

1. **Input Image Selection**

   * Users can take a live photo using a webcam or upload an existing image file.

2. **Reference Image**

   * The user supplies an older photo to use as a baseline for comparison.

3. **Preprocessing**

   * Both images are converted to grayscale.
   * The new image is resized to match the reference image dimensions.
   * The central region of each image is cropped to focus on the scalp area.

4. **Edge Detection**

   * The Canny edge detection algorithm highlights hair strands and texture in each image.

5. **Edge Density Calculation**

   * The ratio of edge pixels (detected hair features) to total pixels is computed for both images.

6. **Analysis**

   * The system calculates the percentage change in edge density and classifies the result as:

     * Hair Thickening
     * Hair Thinning
     * No Significant Change

7. **Output**

   * Displays both original and processed images side by side.
   * Shows the classification result along with the calculated percentage change.

8. **Image Backup**

   * The most recent image is saved for use as a baseline in future comparisons.

## Future Improvements

The current implementation uses basic edge detection for hair density analysis. Planned upgrades include:

* **Automated Hair Region Detection**

  * Use facial or scalp segmentation to isolate the analysis region more accurately.

* **Long-Term Tracking**

  * Store multiple results to visualize density trends over time.

* **Advanced Classification**

  * Train machine learning models to improve classification beyond edge density metrics.

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

  * Create a desktop or web-based interface for easier interaction.

* **Mobile Integration**

  * Develop a mobile app for easier image capture and daily use.
